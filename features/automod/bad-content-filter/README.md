# Bad Content Filter

Bad Content Filter scans each message in your server and deletes messages that are caught by your selected filters. You can change the AI model, set/modify rules, set an alert channel and more!

{% hint style="info" %}
Scanning every message can cause high credit usage in the AI service you use if your server has a large number of messages sent per day.
