## Features

### Localization

We understand the importance of having your Discord bot support multiple languages. The Experiment Hub bot automatically detects your Discord language and translates all the messages for you, providing a seamless experience for users speaking different languages.

### Home

Don't miss any content from the server! Home posts all the popular content on your server to a specific channel. Don't you want to wait for a message to become popular? Simply feature it for it to show in Home!

### AutoMod

The AutoMod feature of the Experiment Hub bot ensures that your server stays safe and free from unwanted content by actively detecting and filtering out inappropriate language and other rule-breaking behaviour. Find detailed information on how to set it up in [this section](./#home).

### Message Reminders

With the Experiment Hub bot, you can have important messages or reminders sent at specific times or intervals. The Message Reminders feature allows you to schedule messages, making it easier to manage events, deadlines, or anything else you want to be reminded of. Learn how to utilize this useful feature in [this section](./#automod).
